		Using gc3 (Gram's Commander v3.3)

			Legal Issues

Writing gc3 has taken a lot of my time and made it difficult
on more than one occasion to pay my rent. As a result, gc3
is now a shareware program. I'm sorry to have to do this, but
unfortunately no-one has been paying me for this and I can't
afford to do it anymore without some subsidy. So, your (the
user) and my (the author) rights are now determined by the following:

1) gc3 may be freely distributed and used in non-commercial, 
   non-profit institutions, or for personal non-commercial use by
   individuals at home, provided it is distributed with all 
   files intact and unmodified.

2) gc3 may not be sold or published in any commercial form for
   profit without my permission (by for profit, I mean at a price
   higher than the media and distribution costs of the medium).
   If you are in the business of making and selling CD-ROMs, and 
   wish to include this program, you may do so in exchange for
   sending me a copy of the CD-ROM.

3) If you use gc3 within a commercial environment, or on a machine
   used for commercial purposes, you are required to register. The
   registration fee is given below. If you have more than 8 users 
   at a site, you may obtain a site license. Contact me for details.

   Registered users will be entitled to a reasonable amount of
   e-mail support (send mail to gram@aztec.co.za).

   Registered users will receive the latest version of gc3, together
   with the full gc3 manual which documents the gc3.key file in more
   detail, as well as documenting GCScript, the language in which the
   gc3.key file is written. This manual will be of particular use to
   those who want to customise gc3 to their own particular preferences.

   Currency should be in the form of internationally acceptable
   bank draughts in US $, UK Sterling, or South African Rands (for
   South African users only). The prices are:
