       _g_c_3  is  a  general-purpose, programmable file manager for
       UNIX and MS-DOS, similar in nature to the  well-known  DOS
       file manager `Norton Commander'.

       When  started  up,  _g_c_3 presents the user with two windows
       containing lists of the files in the directories specified
       by the path arguments, and two windows showing information
       about each of these paths. Each file list  window  has  an
       arrow shaped cursor which points at one of the file names.
       Further information about  the  pointed-at  file  is  also
       shown  in  the  information window. The bottom line of the
       screen is a one- line borderless command window for enter-
       ing  commands.  This is also where error messages are dis-
       played, and where gc3 commands can prompt for input.

       If a path argument(s) is missing, the current directory is
       used  for  the  left-hand  window,  while the path for the
       right hand window will be the directory that  was  current
       when  you  last executed _g_c_3_.  This is determined from the
       iinniittiiaalliissaattiioonn ffiillee _._g_c_3_i_n_i  which  also  saves  the  last
       known  value  of  options and variable settings upon exit.
       _g_c_3 searches for the initialisation path in the  directory
       specified  by the $$GGCCPPAATTHH environment variable. If this is
       not set the $$HHOOMMEE environment variable is used instead.

       The user can move through the file list  with  the  cursor
       keys,  and select/deselect files. Various actions are pos-
       sible upon either the current  file  (namely  the  one  at
       which  the  cursor  is  positioned)  or  upon  the  set of
       selected files in that directory.


       _g_c_3 supports a number of commands. The actual commands may
       vary from site to site (or from user to user). To find out
       the list of commands that _g_c_3 supports at your site, press
       the help key (usually HH ).

       The  behaviour of _g_c_3 is determined by a script file writ-
       ten in a language called _G_C_S_c_r_i_p_t_.  Full  details  of  the
       script  files and how to configure ggcc33 can be found in the
       documentation files  that  accompany  the  registered  gc3
       package. The file UUSSEERR..DDOOCC also contains considerably more
       detailed information about  using  ggcc33  than  this  manual
       entry does.

       --cc          supresses the use of colour.


       --CC          [<script>]  forces  a  script  recompile;  the
                   default script name if one is not specified is
                   `gc3.key'.


       --dd          [  nn  ][  ll ] writes a disassembled listing of
                   the compiled script to stdout.  The  nn  option
                   produces  a  numeric  dump, while the ll ooppttiioonn

       --DD          _<_i_d_> allows you to define identifiers for con-
                   ditional  compilation of the script (used with
                   --CC ).


       --ii          shows the current instruction pointer value at
                   bottom.


       --II          forces the ggcciinniitt function in the script to be
                   called.


       --tt          or --TT write an instruction trace to  the  file
                   ggcc33..iipp  ,  useful for post-mortem debugging.
                   --TT starts the  trace  from  the  execution  of
                   ggcciinniitt while --tt starts from the key processing
                   loop.


       --vv          causes the compiler  to  output  more  verbose
                   messages.

       Under  UNIX,  no lower-case letters other than jj and kk are
       bound. Thus, pressing any of these unbound keys causes the
       ggccddeeffaauulltt  function  to  be called.  This function invokes
       the command line editor after inserting the key  that  was
       pressed  into the command line esitor buffer. You will see
       a prompt CCoommmmaanndd??  at the bottom of the  screen.  You  can
       then  complete  the  command  and  execute  it by pressing
       ENTER. If you end the command with a pipe  character  ||  ,
       the file pager command defined by the $$ppaaggeerr variable will
       automatically be appended to the command line before it is
       executed.

       gc3  includes  a  hypertext  help system with considerably
       more information. You can enter this help system by press-
       ing  Ctrl-B.  The manual which accompanies registered ver-
       sions of gc3 also has considerably more information.

       The default command line editor setup for UNIX is:

       IInnss         Toggle Ins/overstrike modes. You can  see  the
                   current  mode  as a `+' (insert) or `-' (over-
                   strike) at the right hand end of  the  command
                   line
